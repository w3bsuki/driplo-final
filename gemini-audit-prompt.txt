Please conduct a comprehensive Svelte 5, SvelteKit 2, and TypeScript audit of this codebase.

Focus on these 7 key areas:

1. Svelte 5 Migration Status
   - Check for legacy patterns (export let, on:click, <slot>, $:)
   - Verify rune adoption ($state, $derived, $effect, $props)
   - Review event handling patterns

2. SvelteKit 2 Best Practices
   - Route structure and file conventions
   - Data loading patterns (load functions, streaming)
   - Form actions and progressive enhancement
   - API routes and error handling

3. TypeScript Type Safety
   - Type coverage and any usage
   - Type assertions and non-null assertions
   - Generic usage and type imports
   - Interface vs type patterns

4. Component Architecture
   - Props typing and validation
   - Component composition patterns
   - State management approaches
   - Event handling patterns

5. Performance Patterns
   - Bundle splitting and lazy loading
   - Image optimization strategies
   - SSR/hydration optimization
   - Preloading and caching

6. State Management
   - Store patterns (Svelte stores vs classes)
   - Context API usage
   - Form state handling
   - URL state synchronization

7. Security Practices
   - XSS prevention measures
   - CSRF protection implementation
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Authentication and authorization

For each area, provide:
- Current status score (1-10)
- Specific examples with file paths
- Issues found
- Recommendations

End with a prioritized migration roadmap.
