# BRUTAL SVELTE 5 VIOLATIONS AUDIT

## Summary
This codebase is a fucking mess. While most components claim to use Svelte 5 syntax, there are critical violations that make this a half-assed migration at best.

## CRITICAL VIOLATIONS FOUND

### 1. createEventDispatcher Still Being Used (UNACCEPTABLE)
**File:** `src/lib/components/auth/TwoFactorSetup.svelte`
- **Lines:** 2, 9
- **Violation:** Using `createEventDispatcher` which is deprecated Svelte 4 trash
- **Status:** This is 100% broken - createEventDispatcher doesn't exist in Svelte 5
- **Fix:** Use callback props or custom events properly

### 2. Invalid Event Handler Reference (BROKEN CODE)
**File:** `src/lib/components/NotificationPopup.svelte`
- **Line:** 55
- **Violation:** `onclick={handleNotification.action.callback}` - `handleNotification` doesn't exist
- **Status:** This code is BROKEN and will throw runtime errors
- **Fix:** Should be `onclick={notification.action.callback}`

### 3. Export Function Pattern (OLD SYNTAX)
**File:** `src/lib/components/auth/TurnstileWrapper.svelte`
- **Lines:** 41-52
- **Violation:** Using `export function` for component methods
- **Status:** This is old Svelte 4 imperative API pattern
- **Fix:** Should use proper Svelte 5 patterns with stores or state

### 4. Improper Type Definition Pattern
**File:** `src/lib/components/ui/Alert.svelte`
- **Lines:** 5-8
- **Violation:** Using `type $$Props` pattern which is outdated
- **Status:** While it might work, it's not idiomatic Svelte 5
- **Fix:** Use proper typed props with interface definitions

## ADDITIONAL CONCERNS

### Potential Side Effects Outside $effect
Many components have complex initialization logic that might be running outside of proper reactive contexts. This needs deeper investigation.

### Inconsistent Event Handler Patterns
While most components correctly use `onclick` instead of `on:click`, the implementation quality varies wildly.

### Missing Rune Usage
Several components that manage complex state could benefit from `$derived` runes but are using manual calculations.

## VERDICT
This codebase is NOT properly migrated to Svelte 5. Critical components are using deprecated APIs that will break. The migration is incomplete and sloppy.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED
1. Fix the broken NotificationPopup.svelte immediately - it's throwing errors
2. Remove ALL createEventDispatcher usage - it's completely deprecated
3. Refactor TurnstileWrapper to use proper Svelte 5 patterns
4. Audit ALL 288 Svelte files for similar violations

## RECOMMENDATION
Stop claiming this is Svelte 5 code until you actually finish the migration. This half-assed attempt is worse than staying on Svelte 4.
